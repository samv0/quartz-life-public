# Sam Vinh's Digital Garden

> “You have nothing to lose by showing your hand, and everything to gain from being sincere.” — Katie Bird

I told my friends about wanting to start a blog. Except before I start that blog, I must first figure out what blogging website to use. Oh I know! I am a software developer, so I will make my own blog website. Wait, wait, wait! I need to learn how to make a website using NextJS. And so on, and so forth, I spent a year deciding on the approach to take for my blog. I thought long and hard whether I wanted to write blogs at all. 

One day I stumbled into Obsidian. Then, I started journaling. I saw Obsidian Publish. I discovered the concept of a "Digital Garden" and the idea enamored me.

I procrastinated on making this garden because I didn't know what I wanted it to be. I didn't know what I would share with the world. I barely shared myself with friends and family.

I want to start [here](https://life.samvinh.com/content/) and share pieces of life, work, and imagination with you.
